        About Me:
        <br /><br />
        I have been living in Brisbane, Queensland for the last seven years, currently studying <br />
        Introduction to Information Technology, combined with Introduction to Programming.<br />
        My aim is to gain a bachelor's degree in Information Technology or Computer Science.<br /> 
        Past educational experiences include attending TAFE studying information technology at a <br />
        certificate level, completed certificate III, started certificate IV.<br /><br />
        I also studied Automotive Engineering during my teenage/early twenties. Unfortunately, <br />
        circumstances out of my control prevented any further study at the time. Additionally, <br />
        I studied Web Communications as an initial entry attempt into university, about three years ago.<br />

        My interests are programming, 3D (3 Dimensional) modelling, gaming, playing guitar and <br />
        playing golf on odd occasions.I do not usually have an ample amount of time to practice any <br />
        of these skills to any great extent and my lack of expertise shows it. I am of partial <br />
        Russian/New Zealander decent, although being born in Australia. I am only fluent in one <br />
        language being English, though I know and understand a miniscule amount of Russian. <br />
        I have lived in Queensland for most of my life, once venturing to Sydney for a few months, <br />
        an experience to remember which had its highs and lows.
