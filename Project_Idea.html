        Overview<br /><br />
        The ability of being able to measure gas flow or usage in a residential setting has been<br />
        limited in the available options to consumers. As housing developments move into using <br />
        natural gas pipelines to accommodate the consumption thus allowing recent technologies to read usage,<br />
        monitor and control flow into consumer dwellings, that technology has not been utilised for residential <br />
        dwellings that still rely on LPG bottles. My idea is to invent a device that can capture and store usage <br />
        details and then relay that information to the consumers’ personal device, whether it be a personal computer <br />
        or smartphone via wireless technology.<br /><br />
        Motivation<br /><br />
        This idea could be useful to the many consumers who purchase their LPG gas via bottles. The device could <br />
        allow them to track usage, monitor statistics and could have the ability and convenience to reorder or <br />
        replenish their gas before the time is needed. According to CanstarBlue <a href="https://www.canstarblue.com.au/gas/what-is-lpg/#:~:text=LPG%20use%20in%20Australia%201%20Household%20energy%20One,even%20power%20generation.%20...%203%20Fuel%20source%20">CanstarBlue</a>, <br />
        LPG is consumed by on average by a million homes, utilising it for appliances, cooking and heating. <br />
        With around seven million people using LPG for barbeques and outdoor heating. With the use of a custom <br />
        software application paired with either Raspberry Pi hardware or using Arduino hardware, <br />
        this problem could be solved and add more convenience to the LPG user.<br /><br />
        Description<br /><br />
        The product I envision, is the “Flowgauge 1.0.” This device is an LPG flow meter built in with <br />
        a small microcomputer with added wireless technology capability, which then will have the ability to <br />
        connect to a customised application installed on the user’s personal device/s. The product will use <br />
        either raspberry pi or an Arduino interface that is connected to gas flow sensors add capability to monitor,<br />
        record, and transmit data. Initial product size will invariably be of moderate size, accounting for a<br />
        weather shielded enclosure, to allow for all weather conditions. The device will have gas pipe connectors <br />
        on either side, one male adapter, one female adapter to allow for direct connection without the use of adapters.<br />
        The “Flowgauge 1.0” may be adapted for permanent installation or for portable use. Permanent fixture could <br />
        include installation into existing pipework or direct connection to the inlet pipe. In this case of the latter,<br />
        lightweight construction materials would be needed, to prevent damage to the inlet pipe. Also, the device could <br />
        be attached permanently to caravans or recreational vehicles. As for portable use, the device could be utilised <br />
        for barbeque equipment and outdoor heating.<br />
        How this device would work, in theory, the sensors would detect the flow rate of the LPG, intermittently recording <br />
        the flow and storing the data into the onboard storage device. The device would either be connected to a household <br />
        internet connection or could connect through Bluetooth on demand. Once connected, the application would then proceed <br />
        to download the data, analyse, and then output the current usage rate. Initial setup would be required to correctly <br />
        input gas bottle sizes, types of appliances being used. With this information, the device used in conjunction with the <br />
        application interface, the data would then be relayed to the user to display the current usage, remaining gas, and an<br />
        approximate time for before remaining gas is depleted.<br />
        The software would use existing technologies built into the device the application was installed on, for connections<br />
        to the device, features would include secured login for personal security and device recognition, allow the user to <br />
        view current usage statistics as well as store pass statistics for the user comparison between current and past usage <br />
        trends. The remaining gas would also be displayed on the main screen for the user to track, along with the estimated<br />
        remaining time. Notifications would be set to remind users when their LPG is running low, allowing the user time to<br />
        reorder or purchase new bottles. This would be the recommended setting but would be optional, <br />
        according to the users’ preferences.The preferential method of installation would be onto a mobile device<br />
        e.g.; smartphone or a tablet, as existing hardware and software required for connectivity, comes preinstalled onto the device.<br /><br />

        Tools and Technologies<br /><br />
        Utilising a Raspberry Pi or Arduino micro-computer for the main circuitry, the device will have onboard storage<br />
        for recording data, Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth connectivity for connecting to existing networks and transmission of <br />
        the saved data. Also included would be either rechargeable batteries pre-installed or could be permanently connected<br />
        to power via plug-in power cable. A cable would also be included for rechargeable batteries. The software would be <br />
        bundled with the device in the form of a QR (Quick Response) code or website to download from.<br /><br />

        Skills Required<br /><br />
        The skills required for implementation would first off be a software developer who has had experience using <br />
        Raspberry Pi or Arduino software, as well as mobile application development, a keen engineer (professional or amateur)<br />
        to piece together the hardware. The Raspberry Pi and Arduino hardware are readily available for purchase, the gas <br />
        flow sensor is required, but may be too expensive for the outlay. The software will have to be written, which would <br />
        take time, but software companies are abundant or the code could be self-written.<br /><br />

        Outcome<br /><br />
        If this project were to be successful, the outcome could alleviate the stresses related to LPG usage. Giving the end user<br />
        the convenience of knowing when they are due to refill and the ability to monitor usage. The original problem being, <br />
        no consistent way of measuring and tracking LPG usage within the household. Those with natural gas have this convenience<br />
        and no worries of running out at a crucial moment. With the usage of this device and bundled software, this convenience can <br />
        be afforded to those relying on the use of LPG bottles.
