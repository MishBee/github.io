        Above are links to the results of the three tests undertaken.<br /><br />
        How these reflect on my personality are somewhat of interest and provide insight into what <br />
        may have been unknown about myself and a learning experience about oneself. The insights they<br />
        provide may help guide future direction and an opportunity to work on problem areas that may <br />
        hinder further development. The results were accurate in portraying my personality, <br />
        as with all personality types, the results declared my strengths and weaknesses, which I found<br />
        to be quite accurate, and to which I may utilise to my advantage.<br /><br />
        The results show that I may not favour working within groups as have been declared to be quite introverted. <br />
        In saying that, I can work within groups, communicate ideas and perspectives when I have something that <br />
        may be a valuable contribution to the group. I may portray an air of reservation at first, but as I have<br />
        more experiences with peers and colleagues, my reserved nature seems to fade into the background, <br />
        and I feel more relaxed about being open with communication. The overall take on this would be that I <br />
        still have personal areas to improve to be able to a fully effective team member, and the journey of <br />
        self-improvement never ends.<br /><br />
        Factors that should be considered when forming groups, would be to improve communication and take <br />
        a more proactive approach towards learning about fellow team members and to increase input into <br />
        project ideas. Being grouped with more extroverted personalities would ease communication and <br />
        collaboration would be more effective due to openness of other team members, encouraging me to be more open myself.
