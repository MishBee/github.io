        My interests in information technology are software development, robotics, and VR (Virtual Reality).VR and games development. <br />
        I am also interested in the hardware aspect, the ability to piece together different pieces of technology to create a pseudo living system <br />
        to enhance one's surroundings. I would ideally like to enter a career into software development as I have been learning programming as a hobby. <br />
        My aim is to complete a Bachelor’s in Information Technology or Computer Science.<br /><br />
        Information Technology piqued my interest in my early teen years, initially from playing games on a Sega MegaDrive, <br />
        moving up through various consoles. After a lengthy duration, I felt some of the games I would play were lacking in <br />
        certain features, mechanics, gameplay. This in turn, led to an interest in game development, thinking to myself that <br />
        I could one day start developing my own games with the features added that I wished were in others. <br /><br />
        This era of my life was the start of my learning journey into Information Technology.<br /><br />

        My experience with Information Technology has included software development as a hobby, which I am still learning. <br />
        I have also carried out multiple personal computers builds which I have succeeded with, with one being quite recent,<br />
        which was required for the study of this course (Introduction to Information Technology). Software development languages<br />
        that I have had experience with include C++, C#, minor experience with HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS, JavaScript, <br />
        and I am currently learning Python to add to my repertoire. <br /><br />
        Throughout the years, troubleshooting and problem-solving various pieces of technology have been included in my experience. <br />
        My reasoning for studying with RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) was the course outline and structure provided, <br />
        which included the study of various fields I was interested in. Another reason for my choice, was the access to a degree <br />
        without the standard procedures for acceptance, i.e.: Atar score, previous relevant field study. <br /><br />
        Adding access to networking opportunities with industry leaders tutoring and course content provided by people who <br />
        have had the relevant experience within the industry to cater for current demands.<br /><br />
        My expectations for the learning outcomes in this course are to build on previous skills, learn new skills <br />
        and knowledge that are relevant to the Information Technology industry. The eventual goal is to establish and <br />
        maintain a career in the Information Technology field. Through studying this course, I believe I will gain <br />
        knowledge over a broad range of subjects, allowing me to discern a future career path while learning the <br />
        relevant skills necessary to achieve that goal.
